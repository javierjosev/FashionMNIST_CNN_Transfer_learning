# FashionMNIST_CNN_Transfer_learning

## Project Overview:

### Description:
This project, conducted at the University of Buenos Aires, Faculty of Engineering, is part of the postgraduate program in Artificial Intelligence Specialization (CEIA). The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Fashion-MNIST Classification:**
   - In this section, the primary focus is on defining an appropriate architecture for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to address the Fashion-MNIST classification challenge. The main objective is to identify a model that achieves a balance between training cost and accuracy.

2. **Transfer Learning for MNIST Digit Classification:**
   - In the subsequent section, two Transfer Learning strategies are implemented. This involves utilizing the CNN trained in the first part to solve the MNIST digit classification problem. Specifically, the goal is to classify numbers greater or less than 4.5.

### Results:
- Fine-Tuning achieved an outstanding validation accuracy of 0.98, surpassing Feature Extractor, which attained a validation accuracy of 0.94. While both strategies demonstrated excellent performance, Fine-Tuning exhibited a significant advantage due to its minimal parameter training requirement.
